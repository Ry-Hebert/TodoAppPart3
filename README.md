# Todo App

This basic todo app utilizes Node JS, Express JS, and MongoDB to handle data and display it to users.

## Breakdown
* server.js
    This file sets up the overhead and contains the API route handling
      Also be sure to include a .env file to handle variables.
* src/index.html
    This is the main UI page that users interact with
* src/main.js
    This file contains most of the js code for displaying the todo list and handling user input.
  
  ### How it works
  
  To use this app once you have it running use the UI interface to add todo list items to the database and have them displayed. After you have items on the list you can click on the circle next to them to cross them out. Once that first circle has been clicked another one will appear next to it allowing you to delete the item from the database.
